    <p class="text1"> Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
        in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
        to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
        severe diseases than Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
        and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
        discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. </p>
    <p class="text1"> People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
        disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
        the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
        coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
        around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
        these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
        People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
        person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
        why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
        person who is sick</p>

    <p class="text1"> From the above chart we can infer that total number of cases are stongly
         correlated to recovery cases than death cases, over all in India we can say that for every 100 cases
         their will be around 3 death cases and 34 recovery cases.

    <p class="text1">Tripura,Kerala,Bihar and orrisa have least mortality rate compared to total cases.</p>

    <p class="text1">Tripura,Panjab,Chandigarh,Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have worst recovery rate compared
        to total cases.</p>
        
    <p class="text1">Kerala,Telengana and Rajasthan have better recovery rate (high cured cases) compared to total cases.</p>

    <h4 class="table-heading"><u>Conclusion:</u></h4>

    <p class="text1"> Note: consider only total cases greater than 100 (To exclude the biased cases(less than 100 cases) for better analysis on recovery 
        and mortality rate) for Insights.</p>

    <p class="text1"> states having less mortality rate (less deaths) and high recovery rate (high cured cases) 
        like Kerala,J&K,Haryana,Bihar,orrisa are having less number of death cases & high progressive rocovery status 
        and also good at containing the spread of covid cases compared to other states in India.</p>
        
    <p class="text1"> Certain states have higher mortality rate (high deaths) and comparitively less recovery 
        rate (less recovery cases) like West Bengal,Gujarat,Panjab and Maharashtra having more death cases and less recovery rate
        need to check on recovery cases and do more testing to control the spread of pandemic .</p>

    <p class="text1"> If we consider per 100 cases - Kerala , Tripura , Bihar and Tamil Nadu have less than 1 death cases 
        and kerala has around 88 recovery cases which is highest in the country. </p>
